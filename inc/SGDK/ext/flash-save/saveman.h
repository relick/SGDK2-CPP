 * \brief Save manager for flash memory chips supported by the flash module.
 * \author Jesus Alonso (doragasu)
 * \date 10/2022
 *
 * This module allows saving data to non volatile flash chips. It supports as
 * many save slots as required, and arbitrary data lengths can be written to
 * each slot. This allows defining for example a 5 slot layout that uses slot
 * 0 for the game configuration, slot 1 to keep high scores and slots 2 to 4 to
 * save games. Each time data is written to a slot, it replaces whatever was
 * written to the slot previously.
 *
 * The module uses two sectors from the flash chip in order to implement flash
 * wear leveling and safe save: the save file is not lost even if there is a
 * power cut during save operation. Note that typical flash chips used in carts
 * such as Krikkzz Flash Kit Cart use 64 KiB sectors at the end of the flash, so
 * if you want to use this module, it will use the top 128 KiB of the ROM
 * address space by default. Keep this in mind because if code/data falls there,
 * it will be erased by this module routines, breaking your game! There is also
 * a way to use 8 KiB sectors from these carts, in order to waste 16 KiB instead
 * of 128 KiB, but it is a bit tricky, so unless you are very tight on ROM
 * space, better use the default layout. Using the default 128 KiB layout has two
 * additional benefits: wear is reduced and bigger save lengths are possible.
 *
 * Note when you define the slot layout, you must make sure all of them fit in
 * a single sector (plus a bit more room for internal headers). So e.g. if you
 * use 64 KiB sectors and have 5 slots with 2 KiB each, that will fit without a
 * problem, but if you use 8 KiB sectors, that config will not fit (5 x 2 KiB =
 * 10 KiB, bigger than the 8 KiB available in the sector). Make sure your
 * sector configuration is correct, because if it isn't, the module will work
 * initially, but will fail when more slots are saved and they do not fit in
 * one sector.
 *
 * Typical usage of the module is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Call sm_init() to initialize the module. Make sure it is always called
 *    with the same parameters.
 * 2. Call sm_load() to load data, sm_save() to save data and sm_delete() to
 *    delete saved data.
 * 3. In case you need to perform a factory reset, call sm_clear().
 *
 * The module has been carefully written, but some of its logic is a bit
 * complex, so make sure you test it thoroughly just in case there is a bug
 * lurking inside!
 *
 * \note Excepting sm_load(), all module functions stop Z80 and disable
 * interrupts until they return. Thus you shall make sure no music or sound
 * is playing when you call them.
 * \warning Save/load buffers must be word aligned or you will get a
 * SM_STAT_INVALID_PARAM_ERR error. Variables using types with a length equal
 * or bigger than 2 bytes will be aligned (same as structs with at least one
 * variable obeying this rule), but if variable has a type with length 1 (such
 * as a char array), to make sure it is aligned, you can use the attribute:
 * __attribute__((aligned(2))) in the declaration.
 * \warning If any save write operation returns a SM_STAT_HW_ERR, something
 * weird has occurred. Your best chance if this happens is to either restart
 * the console or at least deinit and init this module to let the init routine
 * try correcting the mess and avoid further data loss.

 *            the module defaults to use the last two sectors in the 4 MiB
 *            range. But if you want to restrict it e.g. to 2 MiB to use a
 *            smaller chip, you can set it e.g. to 0x200000. This can also be
 *            used to alloc the smaller sectors in the flash chip, by pointing
 *            to the end of two of these sectors.
 *
 * \return Status code:
 * - SM_STAT_OK if initialisation was successful and flash has data to load.
 * - SM_STAT_WARN_NO_DATA if initialisation was successful but there is no
 *   save data to load.

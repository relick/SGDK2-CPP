 * \brief Low level NOR flash read/erase/write interface.
 * \author Jesus Alonso (doragasu)
 * \date 08/2022
 *
 * This module allows reading, erasing and writing data from/to the
 * cartridge flash chip. It should work with any flash chip compatible with
 * the AMD format, and implementing a CFI interface. It has been tested
 * successfully with S29GL032 and W29GL032C chips. Also it is required that
 * the cart has the WE line connected to the flash chip (that should be the
 * case on most flash carts, but is not guaranteed).
 *
 * \note The module has some limitations: addresses must be even, data pointers
 * must be word aligned, and some functions (flash_init(), flash_sector_erase()
 * and flash_program()) must be run with interrupts disabled and Z80 stopped.
 * Please also take into account that flash suffers from wear, so if you use
 * this e.g. for saving data, avoid saving very frequently and/or implement
 * a wear leveling algorithm to avoid damaging the chip.
 *
 * \note Although it is not a requirement for this module to work, it is
 * strongly recommended that the cart you use also has the RESET pin connected
 * to the console RESET signal. Otherwise, if the user pushes the RESET
 * button while the flash chip is being erased/programmed, the machine will
 * most likely freeze, requiring another press of the RESET button or a power
 * cycle.
